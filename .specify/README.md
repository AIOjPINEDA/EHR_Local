# .specify Usage In This Repository

This folder is kept as an optional Spec-Kit style toolkit.

## Status

- Optional / experimental in this repository.
- Not part of the required default delivery workflow.
- Canonical operational contract remains in `AGENTS.md`.

## Current Assumptions In Scripts

Some `.specify` scripts assume conventions that may differ from this repository defaults:

- Branch naming like `###-feature-name`
- Active specs under `specs/`

Because of that, use `.specify` only when intentionally running a Speckit-style flow.

## Canonical Docs

For daily work in this repository, follow:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/architecture/overview.md`
3. `docs/playbooks/agentic-repo-bootstrap.md`
4. `docs/specs/`
